# Phonebook
Write a python program to illustrate a telephone directory to implement the following features using dictionary
1) Insert name and Phone Number
2) Search phone number based on name
3) Update phone number based on name
4) Delete name and phone number based on name

This program creates an empty dictionary called phonebook, and then defines four functions: insert_number(), search_number(), update_number(), and delete_number().

The insert_number() function takes a name and a phone number as input, and adds them to the phonebook dictionary.

The search_number() function takes a name as input, and returns the corresponding phone number from the phonebook dictionary. If the name is not found in the dictionary, it returns the message "Name not found."

The update_number() function takes a name and a new phone number as input, and updates the phone number in the phonebook dictionary for the corresponding name. If the name is not found in the dictionary, it prints the message "Name not found."

The delete_number() function takes a name as input, and deletes the corresponding name and phone number from the phonebook dictionary. If the name is not found in the dictionary, it prints the message "Name not found."

The program then tests the functions by inserting, searching, updating, and deleting a name and phone number in the phonebook dictionary.
